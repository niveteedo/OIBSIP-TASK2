      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>As a front-end developer with two years of experience,<br>
         I have had the opportunity to work with different clients<br>
        and build responsive and engaging user interfaces.<br>
         During my time at Alpha Company, I was recognized for my<br> 
         work and won the "Best Style Award" for a project I worked on.
        <br>
        In addition to my work at Alpha Company, I have also participated<br>
         in hackathons and was fortunate enough to win two of them. <br>
        These experiences allowed me to collaborate with other developers <br>
        and designers to create innovative and functional web applications.
